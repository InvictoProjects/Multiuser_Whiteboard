# Multiuser_Whiteboard

## Relevance
Online learning is becoming more popular today. No doubt, it is both a convenience and a challenge. It gives you a great deal of flexibility, but with that freedom sometimes you need to solve more different problems: organizing of online learning and convenient presentation of information. For this reason, our team is developing an application that will make your online learning better.

## Concept 
Multiuser Whiteboard is a web application that helps you communicate more easily with other people by visualizing your thoughts on an interactive whiteboard. Users are able to create or join virtual rooms, they can watch and interact with a shared graphics editor. Each user also has the opportunity to communicate through voice and text chats.
